  {
    q: "How does expert-led interviewing work?",
    a: "Companies submit a job description and select a skill domain. InterQ matches the role with a vetted expert who conducts a structured, bias-reduced technical interview. Results include a scorecard covering technical skills, problem solving, communication, and cultural fit.",

  },
  {
    q: "Is candidate and company data secure?",
    a: "Yes. InterQ uses AES-256 encryption, role-based access control, and GDPR-aligned data practices. All interview sessions are handled through secure infrastructure with strict confidentiality protocols.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can interviews be scheduled?",
    a: "Interviews can typically be scheduled within 24–48 hours. Our platform offers real-time expert availability with interactive calendar booking for immediate scheduling.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are Experts vetted?",
    a: "Every expert undergoes a multi-step vetting process including credential verification, domain competency assessment, structured interview training, and ongoing performance review to ensure consistently high-quality evaluations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do candidates receive feedback after their interview?",
    a: "Yes. Each candidate receives a detailed evaluation report covering strengths, areas for improvement, and expert commentary — helping both the hiring team and the candidate understand the assessment outcome.",
  },
